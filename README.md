# webdev-fullstack-challenge-frontend

### Steps to enjoy this to-do manager app:
You need to be sure that your backend is running before start the client side of the application, so lets set fisrt the backend, going to https://github.com/MateoCardonaRincon/webdev-fullstack-challenge-backend and following the instructions in the readme. <br>
If you have the backend running already, lets follow the next steps
#### 1. Clone this frontend repository (either in git bash or using your favorite terminal):
    git clone https://github.com/MateoCardonaRincon/webdev-fullstack-challenge-frontend.git
#### 2. Open the cloned repository in your vscode IDE and install the dependencies (node_modules folder) by typing in your vscode terminal:
    npm install
#### 3. Now, run the client by typing in the vscode terminal the next line command:
    npm run dev
This step will start the application in a develoment build in the url http://localhost:3000/ by default, please make sure you are not running another app in this path,
since the backend is set to receive request from this local url. Open the specified url in your browser, and start creating your first to-do notes!

## Use Case:

  - This is an app about a To-Do task manager, and is just great!

  - Create your custom to-dos with descriptive title and message, and organize them by categories.

  - You can manage the state of your notes as you want. Check a note as done when you finish it, or update the title and message of the ones that are still pending to be completed.

  - If you want to take a note out of your sight, just delete it with a click! Did you finish all the notes of a category? You can also delete the category if you want,
but be careful because all the notes will go with it.

#### What are you waiting for to create your notes?!

### Taking a look at the code:

If you want to take a look at the code of this project you will find three main folders (among other files):
 - app: for the main jsx files and style content
 - componets: for all the react components (and folder with three pages that gather these components)
 - context: for the StoreProvider component and the reducer. <br>

The code has several comments that will give you a clue of what I'm implementing in each block of code,
I hope you don't need them, since that means that my code is not a mess.

Let me know any advice that let me improve. Thank you!
